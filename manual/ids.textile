h1. Manage application.conf in several environments

When you work in a team, different developers will use different configuration keys in their **application.conf**. For example, the log level, some database configuration... This generally leads to recurrent conflicts when you commit the file using your VCS. 

Furthermore, different deployment environments - e.g. dev, test, staging and production - need different configurations.

h2. <a>The framework ID</a>

To resolve this problem, play allows you to give an **ID** to each framework installation. Use the **id** command of the play tool to define this ID :

bc. play id

!images/id!

You can then prefix your configuration keys with the framework ID for which the configuration option is intended :

bc. application.name=Cool app
application.mode=dev
application.log=INFO
 
# Configuration for gbo
%gbo.application.log=DEBUG
%gbo.db=mem
 
# Configuration for src
%scr.http.port=9500
 
# Production configuration
%prod.http.port=80
%prod.application.log=INFO
%prod.application.mode=prod
