~ Synopsis:
~ ~~~~~~~~~
~ play eclipsify [app_path]
~
~ Description:
~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Create all needed configuration file to make the application hosted at the app_path directory an eclipse project.
~ If app_path is omitted, the current directory is used. 
~
~ All needed configuration files including .project and .classpath are created.
~ Several launchers for the application are created as well. The main launcher in usable either with the Run and 
~ Debug eclipse command. The JPDA launcher is only usable with the Run command since it already starts a JPDA agent. 
~ You can then use the Connect JPDA launcher to start a debugging session at any time. Stopping the debugging session 
~ will not stop the server.
~
~ Use File/Import/General/Existing project to import the project into eclipse.
~
~ Use eclipsify again when you want to update eclipse configuration files. It's needed after any classpath change.
~ However, it's often better to delete and re-import the project into your workspace since eclipse keeps dirty caches ...
~
~ The created configuration file contains absolute references to your application, the play framework and all enabled modules.
~ These are specific to your own installation. When you work in a team, each developer must keep his IDE configuration files private.
